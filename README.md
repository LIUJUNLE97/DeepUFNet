Code and Data for DeepUFNet paper "Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware Deep U-Fourier neural Network". To be submitted to [Physical Review Fluids](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/).


In this paper, we have developed a Deep U-[Fourier Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895) to make spatiotemporal experimental wall pressure forecast for a rectangular cylinder. In particular, high-frequency physics loss control is embedded in the model training stage. In the results evaluation stage, we used data-driven technique SPOD to quantify the forecast pressure characteristics. 

The data generation and collection is performed at AIWE lab closed-loop wind tunnel. Our [previous work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029624020686) published in Engineering Structures has provided more details on the lab device and experimental settings. 

Highlights: 
1. Spatiotemporal experimental wall pressure forecast; 
2. Physics-aware DeepUFNet model development; 
3. Fourier Neural Network for high-frequency regime modeling;
4. SPOD for results quantification.
